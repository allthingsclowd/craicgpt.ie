==========================================
The Editor-in-Chief — a LangChain **deep agent** that plans the edition, delegates
to its researchers and editor, and leaves a draft for human approval.

TUTORIAL: create_deep_agent in three lines
-------------------------------------------
A deep agent is the planning tool (``write_todos``), a virtual filesystem, and
subagent delegation (``task``) wrapped around a tool-calling model. We pass our
four subagents and the house system prompt; deepagents wires the rest. The model
is any LangChain chat model — here, a local open-source Qwen3.6 reached through
the grazlab LiteLLM proxy, with a frontier fallback supplied by the caller.

Open source only: no LangSmith, no hosted platform. The agent's plan, subagent
hand-offs, and tool calls are captured by ``trace.TraceRecorder`` for the
"Under the Hood" visualiser — that is our observability story.
